If you are not familiar with this step, please read all the orientation:
For all demultiplexing strategies based on cutadapt the mapping file must be a tab separated text file like this:

head my_mapping_file.txt
sample1   	AGGTACGCAATT	CCTAAACTACGG
sample2    	ACAGCCACCCAT	CCTAAACTACGG
sample3    	TGTCTCGCAAGC	CCTAAACTACGG

then we format it according to your tag primer design using the perl script preparing_tags_LCPI.pl. The dominant tag orientation for Illumina dual index merged pairs: (3'tagF)...(5'RCtagR)
perl preparing_tags_LCPI.pl
#####DEMULTIPLEXING DUAL INDEXED LIBRARIES#####
EXPECTED INPUT:
sample1 tagF    tagR
sample2 tagF    tagR
...     #same as in your excel file
##DO NOT INCLUDE PRIMERS NOW

Please, enter your mapping file to edit: my_mapping_file.txt
>>>For Illumina merged reads type 'linked'
>>>For Illumina combinatorial type 'combinatorial'
>>>For Illumina exact paired dual index type 'unique'
>>>For Ion torrent dual index type 'ion'
>>> type your mode

for merged R1-R2 Illumina files in linked mode, the tags ar formatted like this:
head Barcodes_LA.fa
>sample1    	
^AGGTACGCAATT...CCGTAGTTTAGG$
>sample2    	
^ACAGCCACCCAT...CCGTAGTTTAGG$
>sample3    	
^TGTCTCGCAAGC...CCGTAGTTTAGG$
The ^5' anchoring is default since Cutadapt version 2. The anchoring from both ends, ^5' ... 3'$ gives you the best sequence by sample accuracy, but you always can take a look in the 'unknown.fastq' to search for mismatches that could be acceptable.
You can try different anchoring options:

Edit the preparing_tags_LCPI.pl script with caution. I suggest make a copy to change it: cp preparing_tags_LCPI.pl preparing_tags_LCPI_anchoring3end.pl

For paired files, combinatorial
usual design F1-R1,F2-R1,F3-R1...F1-R9,F2-R9,F3-R9
The barcode files are only converted to fasta end separated:
Barcodes_F.fa   Barcodes_R.fa
>Sample1        >Sample1
CCTAAACTACGG    CCTAAACTACGG
>Sample2        >Sample2
CCTAAACTACGG    TGCAGATCCAAC

it is necessary to write each read pair to an output file depending on the adapters found on R1 and R2 using {name1} and {name2}, which will be replaced with the name of the best-matching F1 and R1 adapter.

paired files,  unique
non-reduntant indexing or unique dual indexing strategy presents the highest accuracy, since the index sequences for i5 and i7 are unrelated, ie there is not F1->F8 repeating over R1-R12

Single-end, Ion torrent dual indexed
The four possible directions of F-R tags are necessary, and they are searched exactly the same way as for linked mode.
                        push (@tags_alt_1, (">$sample\n$tag_F...$RCtagR\n"));
                        push (@tags_alt_2, (">$sample\n$RCtagF...$tag_R\n"));
                        push (@tags_alt_3, (">$sample\n$tag_R...$RCtagF\n"));
                        push (@tags_alt_4, (">$sample\n$RCtagR...$tag_F\n"));

###########################################################################
The argument --lowercase is optional, but I suggest to keep it, you can verify your demultiplexed sequences by samples before actually removing it the next step.
Before the tags and primers clipping, be sure to check the tags and primers in lowercase using, for example, grep commands:
1. Have a look if the dual tags by sample are in place:
Choose any demultiplexed sample:
head my_sample1.fq
@M01334:388:000000000-JBK78:1:1107:9798:24822 1:N:0:CTCTCGTC+TATAACCT
atctagtggcaaACCTCGCAGGTGTCTCCTCTATCTTAGGAGCTGTgtggtatgggag
check if the tags (lowercase) are complete (12bp) or partial, in this example complete, then search for this particular tag pair by running a double grep in your original mapping file:
cat my_mapping_file.tab | grep --color=auto -E -i "atctagtggcaa" my_barcodes.txt | grep "gtggtatgggag"
AIP1a_D ATCTAGTGGCAA    GTGGTATGGGAG
Great, its the same sample name, my_sample1, try some more randomly
2. count sequences
grep -c "^@" > count by line started ( ^ ) as fastq header ( @ ) and the first header letter after '@'
the same, for fasta:
grep -c "^>" my_file.fasta
you can also manually count your demultiplexed sequences:
grep -c -E 'TGCAGATCCAAC|GTTGGATCTGCA' my_file.fasta --> any direction
grep -c -E '^TGCAGATCCAAC|^GTTGGATCTGCA' my_file.fasta --> only 3'-> 5' direction

You can check the primers by the same way.
